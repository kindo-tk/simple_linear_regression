# Simple Linear Regression Calculator

This is an interactive **Simple Linear Regression** calculator built using **Streamlit** and **scikit-learn**. It allows you to enter data points (x and y), compute the regression model, and visualize the regression line. Additionally, it provides predictions based on user input.

## Features
- Enter **x** and **y** values for the regression model.
- View the **slope** and **intercept** of the regression line.
- Visualize the **data points** and the **regression line**.
- Predict the **y value** for a given **x** value.

## Hosted App
You can access the **Simple Linear Regression Calculator** app online at the following link:

[Simple Linear Regression App](https://simplelinearregressionbytk.streamlit.app/)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
To run the app locally, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- **Streamlit**: A framework for creating web applications.
- **scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for Python that includes the Linear Regression model.
- **matplotlib**: A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit scikit-learn matplotlib
```
